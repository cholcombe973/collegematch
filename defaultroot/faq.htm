		<tr>
			<td><a name="faq1"></a>How much does a CollegeMatch subscription cost?</td>
			<td>
				All members may chat, email and view profiles of other members.
				<br>
				Membership to the CollegeMatch website is $4.95/Month
			</td>
    	</tr>
		<tr>
		<td><a name="faq2"></a>How do I post a photo on my profile?</td>
			<td>Posting a photo on CollegeMatch is easy, just
				click on the add photo button in your profile.  From
				there you will be asked to browse for a picture on your
				computer to upload.  After uploading your picture it will
				be reviewed by us.  Within 24-48hrs it will be posted to your
				profile.
				<br>
				Try to keep your photo's smaller than 500k as space is limited.
				Digital pictures with dimensions of 300x200 look the best on this site.
				We'll do our best to make your picture look as good as it can, but
				pictures already in the correct size will look the best.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><a name="faq3"></a>How can I communicate with another member?</td>
			<td>
				Communication with other members is easy.  You can email them while viewing their profile, or
				you can chat with them in one of our chat rooms we have setup.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><a name="faq4"></a>How can I edit my profile?</td>
			<td>
				Editing your profile is straight forward.  Just click on the link in your profile home page
				for edit your profile.  The next page that is shown will fill in your previous values you already
				have.  Then you can edit whatever you'd like to and save them for everyone to view.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><a name="faq5"></a>	Why does the search come up with no matches?</td>
			<td>
				Make your search more general.  Search more school, less specific options and more broad
				categories.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><a name="faq6"></a>Am I required to post a photo?</td>
			<td>
				No by no means are you required to post a photo.  That just makes it easier for people to
				see whether or not they have any initial attraction to eachother.  Imagination only goes so
				far.  Posting a photo on your profile will better your chances of someone becoming interested in you.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><a name="faq7"></a>Do you use cookies on your site?</td>
			<td>
				No.  We've gone to considerable trouble to not invade your privacy.  Personally we dislike the
				idea of saving anything on your computer without your personal consent.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><a name="faq8"></a>I've recieved an email asking for my username and password</td>
			<td>
				This site will never ask you for you username or password through email at any time.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><a name="faq9"></a>Is my password secure?</td>
			<td>
				Yes.  All passwords are safely stored on a server encrypted.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><a name="faq10"></a>Is my information kept private?</td>
			<td>
				Yes.  None of your information will ever be sent out to marketing company's or spam sites.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><a name="faq11"></a>Can I advertise on your site?</td>
			<td>
			 	Yes.  We've devoted space on the site for advertising and sponsors.  Just contact us for pricing
				and availability.
